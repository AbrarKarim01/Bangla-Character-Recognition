In this project, we are going to build an AI system that will use the live feed coming from the webcam and check the trace and depth using virtual painting. It will track the 


## Features


- Hand Tracking with depth
- Virtual Drawing
- Bangla Character Recognition


## Project Description

We demonstrate research on depth real-time hand tracking systems. It accurately and quickly tracks a fully articulated hand at high frame rates (30 FPS on a desktop without a GPU) (error below 45-50 mm). To optimize and test the process we have used PSO local optimizer and to observe accuracy and usage we used a gesture model (Virtually drawn Bangla  Characters) as a virtual painting tool. 
Our system is built using numerous methods. With the use of several spheres, we model a hand quickly and efficiently. In order to perform in real-time, those are essential. 

## Requirements


- [OpenCv] - OpenCV provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library, tools, and hardware.
- [Mediapipe] - MediaPipe offers open-source cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.
- [Pyswarms] - PSO, Particle Swarm Optimizer, Local Optimizer.


## Installation

- Pycharm - Pycharm is an environment for Python language and it is downloadable from their website.
- Install the packages under pycharm to start the project.
