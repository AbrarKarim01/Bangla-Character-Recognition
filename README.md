# Hand-TEc

## Hand Tracking with Depth


In this project we are going to build an AI system which will be using the live feed coming from the webcam to create a virtual mouse using hand tracking

## Features

- Hand Tracking
- Virtual Mouse
- Virtual Drawing

## Project Description

In this project we are going to use our hand to track virtually as a mouse without any physical system. We are going to use our WebCam for detection of one of our hands. It will then create a bounding box around my hand and focus on two fingers: The fore finger and the middle finger. The fore finger will act as a cursor and moving it around, we will be moving the cursor around. Now, inorder to successfully click using hand tracking, it is detecting the distance between the fore finger and the middle finger. If they are joined together, then it will perform a click.
