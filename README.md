# Hand-TEc

## Hand Tracking with Depth


In this project we are going to build an AI system which will be using the live feed coming from the webcam and check the trace and depth using virtual painting.


## Features


- Hand Tracking with depth
- Virtual Drawing


## Project Description

We demonstrate a research on depth real-time hand tracking system. It accurately and quickly tracks a fully articulated hand at high frame rates (30 FPS on a desktop without a GPU) (error below 45-50 mm). To optimize and test the process we have used PSO local optimizer and to observe accuracy and usage we used gesture model and as a virtual painting tool.
Our system is built using numerous methods. With the use of several spheres, we model a hand quickly and efficiently. In order to perform in real time, those are essential. 

## Requirements


- [OpenCv] - OpenCV provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library, tools, and hardware.
- [Mediapipe] - MediaPipe offers open source cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.
- [Pyswarms] - PSO, Particle Swarm Optimizer, Local Optimizer.


## Installation

- Pycharm - Pycharm is an enviroment for Python language and it is downloadable from there website.
- Install the packages under pycharm to start the project.
